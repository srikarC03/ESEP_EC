# ESEP_EC
A python class for a simple in memory database to keep track of transactions

Get Started:
Download the file into your project directory
In your main file add the following line to the top
'from InMemDB import Database'
from there you should be able to create a Database object and utilize its methods.

Improvements:
Because this assignment is so simple I think a few more methods should be added and some clearer instructions. I think some clearer instructions 
on the methods and some more guidelines on the code should be added to handle more specific edge cases. I think similar to RDBs some methods to query the database
for specific data should be added to increase the complexity. If multiple transactions are attempted at the same time to mimic real databases, some sort of way to resolve
those conflicts should be implemented also.
